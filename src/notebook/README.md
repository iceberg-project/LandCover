We present a Jupyter notebook as a demonstration of how to process high-resolution satellite imagery of Antarctica to determine the landcover classification.  This notebook works through the various                       steps from raw digital number GEOTIFF data to top-of-atmosphere radiance, conversion to                                 surface radiance then surface reflectance.  Spectral ratios are then computed from the surface reflectance.    Ratios have been determined from ground observations to identify areas of water, ice, snow, and geologic features.

This notebook is a simplification of Python code used for large scale processing on high performance computing (HPC) systems and can be extended for use on HPC and for non-Antarctic regions.
